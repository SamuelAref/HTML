Introduction

          discovered through a search engine's organic search results.

          Note: Organic serach results are the query results which are
                calculated strictly algorithmically and not affected by advertiser payments.

    Benefits of SEO

        - Organic traffic is typially consistent once you're ranking high.
        - You have the opportunity to reach massive audiences ( in 2019 there were 4 billion google users).

    How google works 

        - Crawlers and Indexers - allows google to discover informations and gather indexes to return the result 
        - Google's ranking algorithms -

                - backlinks - links  on a page from one website to another 
                - Search Intent - what exactly are you searching
                - Content Depth - a page's depth about that topic being searched 

Module #1 : Keyword Research

        1.1 Keywords

                - Words and phrases that people type into search engines to find what they're looking for.
                - Key words are the foundation for SEO 
                - Keyword Research is the process of finding keywords that people are inputting into search engines.

                How do you Choose Keywords worth targeting?

                    - Search Demand - represents the volume of monthly searches made for a keyword. ( you can check words in ahrefs website)
                                    - but these searches can be misleading, because for example if we search for miles to kilometers in google,
                                      then it will calculate it automatically on the google page without any page click.

                    - Topic traffic potential - Represents the total search traffic you could get if you were to rank at the top of google for your keyword.
                                              
                    - Business potential of keyword/topic - Represents the value a keyword has to your business.

                                            - Example , if you have a website about golf (selling used golf clubs), you would rank the following searches 3 being important and 0 being not important 

                                                            Search 1 - "Buy used golf clubs" - rank as 3 because it is directly related to your website
                                                            Search 2 - "best golf clubs" - rank as 2 because it is not directly related but still refers to your product
                                                            Search 3 - "what is a handicap in golf" - rank as 1 because it's almost not related to your website 
                                                            Other searches with ranking as 0, you can ignore these as these are not related in anyway relevant to your website

                    - Match search intent - represents the reason behind a searcher's query.

                                - Example - if you have a recipe website, and the user searches for toaster oven.
                                          - your search won't be able to satisfy the user's intent so you will not rank.
                                
                    - Determine whether you can rank for your keyword - is it worth ranking??

        1.2 Search intent 

                - What is search intent
